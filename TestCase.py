Certainly! Below is a Python script using Selenium 4.0 to automate the scenario you described. The script includes dynamic waits at each step to ensure elements are loaded before interacting with them.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Initialize the WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver for your browser

try:
    # Visit the website
    driver.get('https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/')

    # Wait until the "Mens" menu is clickable and click it
    mens_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, 'Men'))
    )
    mens_menu.click()

    # Wait until the "Tops" submenu is visible and click it
    tops_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, 'Tops'))
    )
    tops_menu.click()

    # Wait until the "Tees" submenu is visible and click it
    tees_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, 'Tees'))
    )
    tees_menu.click()

    # Wait until the product grid is visible and select the first product
    first_product = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, '.product-item .product-item-info'))
    )
    first_product.click()

    # Wait until the "Add to Cart" button is clickable and click it
    add_to_cart_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, 'product-addtocart-button'))
    )
    add_to_cart_button.click()

    # Optionally, wait until the cart is updated (e.g., cart count is updated)
    cart_count = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.text_to_be_present_in_element((By.CSS_SELECTOR, '.counter-number'), '1')
    )

    print("Product added to cart successfully!")

finally:
    # Close the WebDriver
    driver.quit()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The WebDriver is initialized for Chrome. Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver installed and available in your PATH.
2. **Visit the Website**: The script navigates to the specified URL.
3. **Dynamic Waits**: At each step, the script waits for the element to be clickable or visible before interacting with it. This ensures that the script does not fail due to elements not being loaded.
4. **Clicking Elements**: The script clicks on the "Men" menu, then "Tops", and finally "Tees".
5. **Selecting a Product**: The script waits for the product grid to be visible and clicks on the first product.
6. **Adding to Cart**: The script waits for the "Add to Cart" button to be clickable and clicks it.
7. **Verification**: Optionally, the script waits until the cart count is updated to ensure the product was added successfully.
8. **Cleanup**: The WebDriver is closed at the end of the script.

Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed (`selenium` and the appropriate WebDriver for your browser). You can install Selenium using pip:

```sh
pip install selenium
```

Also, ensure that the WebDriver executable (e.g., `chromedriver` for Chrome) is in your system's PATH or specify the path to the executable when initializing the WebDriver.
