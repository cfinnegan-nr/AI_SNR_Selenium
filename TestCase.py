Certainly! Below is an example of how you can achieve the described scenario using Selenium 4.3 with Python. This script will visit the Magento website, navigate through the menu to select "mens > tops > tees", and then select a product to add to the cart. Dynamic waits (WebDriverWait) are used to ensure that elements are loaded before interacting with them.

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Initialize the WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

try:
    # Visit the website
    driver.get("https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/")
    
    # Wait for the "Mens" menu to be clickable and click it
    mens_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, "Men"))
    )
    mens_menu.click()
    
    # Wait for the "Tops" submenu to be visible and click it
    tops_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, "Tops"))
    )
    tops_menu.click()
    
    # Wait for the "Tees" submenu to be visible and click it
    tees_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.LINK_TEXT, "Tees"))
    )
    tees_menu.click()
    
    # Wait for the product grid to be visible and select the first product
    first_product = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".product-item"))
    )
    first_product.click()
    
    # Wait for the "Add to Cart" button to be clickable and click it
    add_to_cart_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "product-addtocart-button"))
    )
    add_to_cart_button.click()
    
    # Optionally, wait for the confirmation message or cart update
    cart_message = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".message-success"))
    )
    print(cart_message.text)

finally:
    # Close the WebDriver
    driver.quit()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialize the WebDriver**: This script uses ChromeDriver. Make sure you have the appropriate WebDriver installed and available in your PATH.
2. **Visit the Website**: The script navigates to the Magento website.
3. **Navigate through the Menu**: The script waits for each menu item to be clickable before clicking it. This ensures that the elements are loaded and ready for interaction.
4. **Select a Product**: The script waits for the product grid to be visible and then selects the first product.
5. **Add to Cart**: The script waits for the "Add to Cart" button to be clickable and then clicks it.
6. **Confirmation Message**: Optionally, the script waits for a confirmation message to appear and prints it.
7. **Close the WebDriver**: Finally, the script closes the WebDriver to clean up resources.

Make sure to install the necessary packages using pip if you haven't already:

```sh
pip install selenium
```

Also, ensure that your ChromeDriver version matches your installed Chrome browser version.
