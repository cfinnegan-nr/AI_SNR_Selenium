Certainly! Below is an example of how you can achieve the described scenario using Selenium 4.3 with Python. This script includes dynamic waits at each step to ensure that elements are loaded before interacting with them.

First, make sure you have Selenium installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

Here's the Python script:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Initialize the WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # You can use any other driver like Firefox, Edge, etc.

try:
    # Visit the website
    driver.get("https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/")

    # Wait until the 'Mens' menu is clickable and click it
    mens_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//span[text()='Men']"))
    )
    mens_menu.click()

    # Wait until the 'Tops' submenu is visible and click it
    tops_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//span[text()='Tops']"))
    )
    tops_menu.click()

    # Wait until the 'Tees' submenu is visible and click it
    tees_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//span[text()='Tees']"))
    )
    tees_menu.click()

    # Wait until the products are loaded and select the first product
    first_product = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "(//a[@class='product-item-link'])[1]"))
    )
    first_product.click()

    # Wait until the 'Add to Cart' button is clickable and click it
    add_to_cart_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "product-addtocart-button"))
    )
    add_to_cart_button.click()

    # Optionally, wait for the confirmation message or cart update
    cart_confirmation = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.XPATH, "//div[@data-bind='html: $parent.prepareMessageForHtml(message.text)']"))
    )
    print("Product added to cart successfully!")

finally:
    # Close the WebDriver
    driver.quit()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialize the WebDriver**: This script uses Chrome WebDriver. Make sure you have the appropriate WebDriver installed and available in your PATH.
2. **Visit the Website**: The script navigates to the Magento website.
3. **Dynamic Waits**: The script uses `WebDriverWait` along with `expected_conditions` to wait for elements to be clickable or visible before interacting with them.
4. **Navigate through Menus**: It clicks through the Men > Tops > Tees menu items.
5. **Select a Product**: It selects the first product listed.
6. **Add to Cart**: It clicks the "Add to Cart" button.
7. **Confirmation**: Optionally, it waits for a confirmation message to ensure the product was added to the cart.
8. **Close the WebDriver**: Finally, it closes the browser.

Make sure to adjust the XPaths and other locators if the website structure changes.
