Certainly! Below is the Python code using Selenium 4.0 to automate the described scenario with dynamic waits at each step. The custom initialization of the WebDriver is also included as per your instructions.

```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains

# Import the custom driver initialization function
from config import get_chrome_driver

# Initialize the driver using the custom configuration
driver = get_chrome_driver()

# Visit the Magento website
driver.get("https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/")

# Wait until the 'Mens' menu is clickable and click it
mens_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//span[text()='Men']"))
)
mens_menu.click()

# Wait until the 'Tops' submenu is clickable and click it
tops_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//span[text()='Tops']"))
)
tops_menu.click()

# Wait until the product list is visible and select the first product
first_product = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".product-item-info"))
)
first_product.click()

# Wait until the size options are visible and select the first size
first_size = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".swatch-option.text"))
)
first_size.click()

# Wait until the color options are visible and select the first color
first_color = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".swatch-option.color"))
)
first_color.click()

# Wait until the 'Add to Cart' button is clickable and click it
add_to_cart_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "product-addtocart-button"))
)
add_to_cart_button.click()

# Optionally, you can close the driver after the operations
driver.quit()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The WebDriver is initialized using a custom function `get_chrome_driver()` from the `config` module.
2. **Navigation and Interaction**:
   - The script navigates to the Magento website.
   - It waits for the 'Men' menu to be clickable and clicks it.
   - It waits for the 'Tops' submenu to be clickable and clicks it.
   - It waits for the product list to be visible and selects the first product.
   - It waits for the size options to be visible and selects the first size.
   - It waits for the color options to be visible and selects the first color.
   - It waits for the 'Add to Cart' button to be clickable and clicks it.
3. **Dynamic Waits**: `WebDriverWait` is used to implement dynamic waits, ensuring that the script waits for elements to be interactable before performing actions on them.
4. **Cleanup**: The WebDriver is closed using `driver.quit()` after the operations are completed.

This script should work as expected, provided that the `config` module and the `get_chrome_driver` function are correctly implemented.
