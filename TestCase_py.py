#Certainly! Below is a Python script using Selenium 4.0 to automate the scenario you described. This script includes dynamic waits (WebDriverWait) to ensure that elements are loaded before interacting with them.

#```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from config import get_chrome_driver

# Initialize the driver using the custom configuration
driver = get_chrome_driver()

# Test code here
try:
    # Visit the website
    driver.get("https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/")
    
    # Wait until the "Mens" menu is clickable and click it
    mens_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//span[text()='Men']"))
    )
    mens_menu.click()
    
    # Wait until the "Tops" submenu is visible and click it
    tops_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//a[text()='Tops']"))
    )
    tops_menu.click()
    
    # Wait until the "Tees" submenu is visible and click it
    tees_menu = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, "//a[text()='Tees']"))
    )
    tees_menu.click()
    
    # Wait until the products are loaded and select the first product
    first_product = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".product-item-info"))
    )
    first_product.click()
    
    # Wait until the "Add to Cart" button is clickable and click it
    add_to_cart_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "product-addtocart-button"))
    )
    add_to_cart_button.click()
    
    # Optionally, you can wait for the confirmation message or cart update
    cart_confirmation = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".message-success"))
    )
    print("Product added to cart successfully!")

finally:
    # Close the WebDriver
    driver.quit()
#```

### Explanation:
# 1. **Initialize the WebDriver**: This script uses Chrome WebDriver. Make sure you have the appropriate WebDriver installed and available in your PATH.
# 2. **Visit the Website**: The script navigates to the Magento website.
# 3. **Dynamic Waits**: The script uses `WebDriverWait` to wait for elements to be clickable or visible before interacting with them. This ensures that the script does not fail due to elements not being loaded yet.
# 4. **Clicking through the Menus**: The script clicks through the "Men", "Tops", and "Tees" menus.
# 5. **Selecting a Product**: The script selects the first product listed.
# 6. **Adding to Cart**: The script clicks the "Add to Cart" button and waits for a confirmation message.

# ### Prerequisites:
# - Install Selenium using pip:
#   ```bash
#   pip install selenium
#   ```
# - Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome) and ensure it is in your PATH.

# This script should work for the given scenario. Adjust the selectors if the website structure changes.
